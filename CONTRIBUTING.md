# Contributing to my ESPHome config

This project mainly contains configuration (YAML) files for my own ESPHome devices which can be used as example for others.
Contributing directly may not seem that useful.

That being said, any possible improvements will be hugely appreciated so if you see something which can be improved, please create an issue (of some kind) or pull request.
